## Adding a New AI Tool

To add detection for a new AI tool, update the pattern list in `src/known_tools.rs`. Each entry needs a case-insensitive pattern and a canonical tool name.

## Adding a New Detection Method

New detectors go in `src/detector/`. Implement detection logic, then register it in `src/detector/mod.rs` within `run_all_detectors()`.
